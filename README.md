resources).
- **Innovations**: Point out unique optimizations, customizations, or novel
approaches.

#### 4- ML Tasks

- Solve **3** different ML tasks for your theme, ex:
    - **Regression**: to predict player performance metrics like speed, stamina, or scoring potential.
    - **Classification**: to identify the genre of a song or moderating in-game chat.
    - **Clustering**: to identify team formations
    - **Object** detection and action recognition: to identify key actions like goals, passes, or fouls in
match footage.
    - **Gaze estimation**: to analyze where players are looking during critical moments
    - **Sentiment analysis**: on social media or fan forums

#### 5- Model Evaluation

- **Metrics**: Show metrics relevant to your problem (e.g., accuracy, precision,
recall, RMSE).
- **Comparison**: If applicable, compare models or baselines.
- **Visuals**: Include plots or charts (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curve).

    - **Usage**: Highlight how users interact with it (e.g., web app, mobile app).
    - **Scalability**: Mention steps taken to ensure the system can handle real-world usage

- **Demo**:
    - Brings the ML pipeline to life!
    - Create a live or interactive demo to demonstrate the practical viability of the pipeline beyond just theory or code.
